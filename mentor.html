            TIM BERNERS-LEE is a British computer scientist who is credited with inventing the World Wide Web. He was
            born on June 8, 1955, in London, England. <br>
            Berners-Lee attended the Queen's College, Oxford University, where he received a degree in physics in 1976.
            He went on to work at Plessey Telecommunications and then at the European Organization for Nuclear Research
            (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland, where he developed a software program to help scientists share information.
            In 1989, Berners-Lee proposed the concept of a global hypertext system, which would allow people to access
            and share information over the Internet. He developed the first Web browser and Web server, and on August 6,
            1991, he made the World Wide Web available to the public for the first time. <br>
            Berners-Lee went on to found the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1994, which is an international
            community that develops open standards for the Web. He has also been a strong advocate for net neutrality
            and online privacy. <br>
            In addition to his work on the Web, Berners-Lee has also been involved in various other technology-related
            projects, including the Semantic Web, which is an extension of the Web that enables machines to understand
            the meaning of information on the Web. <br>
            Berners-Lee has received numerous awards and honors for his contributions to the development of the Web,
            including the Turing Award in 2016, which is considered the highest honor in computer science. He has also
            been knighted by Queen Elizabeth II and inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame.
